About this port of Camel Forth:

This is a ZDSII_eZ80Acclaim!_5.3.4 project, which contains three separate builds:
See https://www.zilog.com zds2_eZ80Acclaim!_5.3.4_19112104.zip
These projects are configured to build for the eZ80F91 Development Board
Revision 99C0858-001 Rev C or later.

 - One build is 'Debug', which runs entirely out of 512KB eZ80F91 Module SRAM
    as ROM mapped at 000000-07FFFFh for code and Chip's SRAM B7D000h-B7FFFFh continued
    by DevPlattform's B80000h-BFFFFFh data SRAM
   directly from ZDS-II.

 - The other is 'Release', which generates a HEX file, to burn into
   the eZ80F91 on-chip Flash with the Flash Loader (found in the Tools
   menu of ZDS II). Chip's ROM 000000h-03FFFFh and Chip's SRAM B7D000h-B7FFFFh continued
   by DevPlattform's B80000h-BFFFFFh and Module's C00000h-C7FFFFh data SRAM

Select the build using 'Set Active Configuration' from the 'Build' menu,
or from the toolbar.

The HEX file is included -- you can burn the Flash, press reset, and
you're running.

If you plan to embed this into a commercial product (for manufacturing test,
in-lab use, field diagnostics, etc.), please contact the author for a
very reasonable licensing deal, e.g. per board, or unlimited distribution.
